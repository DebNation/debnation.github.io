I have been using their 2a Plus model for 6 months, so it was my first phone with an AMOLED display I didn't knew what are the quirks of an OLED display,
when I got the phone I didn't noticed anything unusual everything was like it supposed to be but then after 4-5 days when I first opened my phone camera in a very dark place at night,
I saw the camera (I mean display) got all grany green colors on it and it scared me I thought camera is damaged but then when I came to a bright place everything seems to be normal so I started searching immediately about the issue then I found that google says it's normal for AMOLED display to show some green and purple tints but my friends phones didn't have this exaggerate tints when I compared with a friend of mine and I found something strange is that when I played a LG OLED video in a spot my phone display showing weird colors but his is not.
So that day when I was going to sleep and when I put the brightness to very low sometimes strange happend everthing became the same greenish tint and even some green distored pixel lines when I open statusbar panel when phone is locked.
I have seen some threads on reddit and their offical forum that it is software issue but when I deep dived it is not this happens because of display is incapable of showing some dark shades color in this case it is #030303.
I also having to attempt 3-4 times to open the phone using In-Display-Fingerprint Sensor, I think due to the faulty dislay fingerprint recognition also hampered.
Nothing corp knew about the issue and did push a OS update where it changes the lock screen shade color to pitch black so that green tint won't be visible but does that fix the main problem!
no, it's not.
As far as I know VisionX manufactured has this issue more prominent than BOE manufactured display, but both of them are bad in comparison to the phones display quality you get in this price range.
So where ever this color is present the display shows green and purple tints, and even some HDR movies dark scenes got so bad(green/purple tint) I decided to contact their support.
Next day morning I called to their support and they told me that this is normal for OLED displays, I have told them this is only happening to only my phone display but why not in my fried phone and they told me if I am so worried about it I have to go to their service centre,
I have seen some reddit users to go their service and centre and showed them the problem but the support team does not recognize this is an issue, even if for some people they recognize it even get a display replacement it is same faulty manufactured diplay they are replacing with so that's not gonna fix anything,
that display costs around 7000 INR if not in warranty,if I try to replace the original display with third party display it will just make the things worse because most of the time those cheap display are even lower quality and has heating issues,
I have primarily bought it to watch HDR movies but can't do it properly, So I have decided to sell the phone on OLX and I got around 15k INR for the phone and I have bought a refurbished IQOO Z9 from IQOO official site at 11k, the phone is like new and since then I am not seeing those greenish and purpleish tint so exxagerated anymore on this display.

TLDR; Be careful when buying phones from nothing they does cost cutting on parts where it matters.
