  void linux is so fast
</h1>

<h3 id="what-is-void-linux">What is Void Linux:</h3>
<p>void is a systemd-free runit based init system distro, who tries to be a independent free of the systemd monopoly and give it's users a clean system experience.</p>
<h2 id="why-you-should-use-void-in-my-opinion">Why You should Use Void(in my opinion)</h2>
<h4 id="1-package-manager">1. Package manager:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Void has a one of the best package manager out there, it's very fast although the mirrors are kind of slow.</li>
<li>Void packages are very small, they don't include debug packages when you install some core utils, so that does make it very lightweight.</li>
<li>Void package availability is surprisingly much better than pacman, or I think so excluding aur, found some packages in void repo which aren't available in pacman.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="2-runit">2. Runit:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Runit is very fast even faster than systemd, boot time is less than 5 sec, unlike openrc it starts services in parallal.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="3-stability">3. Stability:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Void is very stable, even though though they are rolling release linux distribution, it is rock solid, the packages are rarely breaks.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="4-documentation">4: Documentation:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Yes, I know their documentation sucks, but it is great when you don't need alot of things to run a system, it covers almost all the basic things needed to setup or fix.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="5-very-small-footprint">5: Very Small Footprint:</h4>
<table><thead><tr><th>Architechture</th><th>CPU</th><th>RAM</th><th>Storage</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>x86_64-glibc</td><td>x86_64</td><td>96MB</td><td>700MB</td></tr>
<tr><td>x86_64-musl</td><td>x86_64</td><td>96MB</td><td>600MB</td></tr>
<tr><td>i686-glibc</td><td>Pentium 4 (SSE2)</td><td>96MB</td><td>700MB</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<ul>
<li>The base memory foot print is very small even smaller than arch linux.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="6-downsides">6: DownSides:</h4>
<ul>
<li>It is not updated as fast as arch linux does although some packages are faster to provide update.</li>
<li>Void has problems with NVIDIA GPU by default it uses open-source Nouveau driver so the distro gets stuck while booting into it, atleast it got stuck for me many times, you may need to switch to proper drivers.</li>
<li>Void works best with Xorg, and wayland compositors like hyprland are not available in void through offical repository.</li>
</ul>
