Void Linux:\nvoid is a systemd-free runit based init system distro, who tries to be a independent free of the systemd monopoly and give it's users a clean system experience.\nWhy You should Use Void(in my opinion)\n1. Package manager:\n\nVoid has a one of the best package manager out there, it's very fast although the mirrors are kind of slow.\nVoid packages are very small, they don't include debug packages when you install some core utils, so that does make it very lightweight.\nVoid package availability is surprisingly much better than pacman, or I think so excluding aur, found some packages in void repo which aren't available in pacman.\n\n2. Runit:\n\nRunit is very fast even faster than systemd, boot time is less than 5 sec, unlike openrc it starts services in parallal.\n\n3. Stability:\n\nVoid is very stable, even though though they are rolling release linux distribution, it is rock solid, the packages are rarely breaks.\n\n4: Documentation:\n\nYes, I know their documentation sucks, but it is great when you don't need alot of things to run a system, it covers almost all the basic things needed to setup or fix.\n\n5: Very Small Footprint:\nArchitechtureCPURAMStorage\nx86_64-glibcx86_6496MB700MB\nx86_64-muslx86_6496MB600MB\ni686-glibcPentium 4 (SSE2)96MB700MB\n\n\nThe base memory foot print is very small even smaller than arch linux.\n\n6: DownSides:\n\nIt is not updated as fast as arch linux does although some packages are faster to provide update.\nVoid has problems with NVIDIA GPU by default it uses open-source Nouveau driver so the distro gets stuck while booting into it, atleast it got stuck for me many times, you may need to switch to proper drivers.\nVoid works best with Xorg, and wayland compositors like hyprland are not available in void through offical repository.\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/void-linux-is-so-fast/","title":"Void linux is so fast"}},"docInfo":{"http://127.0.0.1:1111/":{"body":0,"title":0},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/":{"body":0,"title":3},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/second/":{"body":1,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/void-linux-is-so-fast/":{"body":193,"title":3}},"length":4},"lang":"English"}
